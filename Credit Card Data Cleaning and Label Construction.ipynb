    "## In this notebook, I analyze [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction). The dataset consists of demographic and financial data for accounts at a bank (unspecified) along with a credit history of that account. The same customer at the bank may have multiple accounts attached to them. The goal of the notebook is to clean up the data and construct a label for each customer using all of their accounts as good or bad credit. This notebook will later be used to build a model to predict the credit score of customers using their demographic and financial data, to quantify the risk of opening a credit account."
